## Introduction

I have been studying some of the most used algorithms in programming. <br>
I created this repository in order to practice coding and solidify my knowledge of how these algorithms work. 
I have chosen [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) since it's a friendly language for beginners and i'm already quite familiar with it.

## Project Setup

You'll only need [Docker](https://www.docker.com) to run this project. 
This project uses standalone `Zeitwerk` to auto load code located at the `lib` folder

- Installing the gems <br>

      bin/setup

- Accessing the ruby container <br>

      bin/bash

- Running tests suite <br>

      bin/rspec
